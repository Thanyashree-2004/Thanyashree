In your program, you are checking for equality between fdn and rev_num after you have already modified fdn and calculated rev_num. Since fdn has been modified in the process of calculating rev_num, comparing it to rev_num will not yield the expected result.

To fix this, you should store the original value of fdn in a separate variable before performing the calculations. Then you can compare the original value with the reversed number. Here's the corrected version of your code:
